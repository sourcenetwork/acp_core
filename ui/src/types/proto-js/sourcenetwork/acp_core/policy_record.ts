 * ManagementGraph represents a Policy's Relation Management Graph.

 * The ManagementGraph is a directed graph which expresses the notion of Relation Management Authority.
 * Relation Management Authority is the idea that a certain set of relationships with relation R will be managed by an actor with relation RM.
 * Thus we can say RM manages R, meaning that if an actor A has a relationship 'actor {A} is a {RM} for {O}' where O is an object,
 * then Actor A can create relationships 'actor {S} is a {R} for {O}' for any actor S.
 *
 * Nodes in the Graph are Relations in a Policy.
 * Edges point from one Relation to another.
 *
 * NOTE: This proto definition should be treated as an *abstract data type*,
 * meaning that the fields should not be manually editted.
